# âš  THIS IS THE DEVELOPMENT BRANCH. DON'T USE THIS BRANCH BECAUSE IT'S BROKEN ALL THE TIME âš 

ASA (Anime Scraper API) is an API to scrap information from anime websites. This was made for another project, but now is entirely separated. However, **is not meant to use in production**. It was made just for fun.

## THE PROJECT IS BEING REWRITTEN FOR BETTER SUPPORT IN THE FUTURE
### This means that **breaking changes will be made**, and you'll probably need to change stuff. **Don't use this module in production**.
