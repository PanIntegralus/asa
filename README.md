ASA (Anime Scraper API) is an API to scrap information from anime websites. This was made for another project, but now is entirely separated. However, **is not meant to use in production**. It was made just for fun.

## THIS IS UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT, DON'T USE THIS IN PRODUCTION
### This means that **breaking changes will be made**, and you'll probably need to change stuff.
