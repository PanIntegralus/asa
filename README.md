ASA (Anime Scraper API) is an API to scrap information from anime websites. This was made for another project, but now is entirely separated. However, **is not meant to use in production**. It was made just for fun.

# THIS IS UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT, DON'T USE THIS IN PRODUCTION
### This means that **breaking changes will be made**, and you'll probably need to change stuff.

## Installation
```
npm install asa-api --save
```

---
## Example
```js
const asa = require('asa-api');
asa.getAnime("animeflv", "86")
    .then(res => console.log(res))
```
Output should be something similar to this:
```json
[
  {
    title: '86 - Eighty Six',
    url: 'https://ww3.animeflv.cc/anime/86-eighty-six',
    img: 'https://img.animeflv.cc/cover/86-eighty-six.jpg'
  },
  {
    title: '86 2nd Season',
    url: 'https://ww3.animeflv.cc/anime/86-2nd-season',
    img: 'https://img.animeflv.cc/cover/86-2nd-season.jpg'
  }
]
```
